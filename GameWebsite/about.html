        <div class="center">
        <p>Hello world! I am Coffee Specialist Beanito and I enjoy coffee, obviously.
            <br>But whenever I'm not drinking coffee or ranting about coffee or trying
            new coffee shops I'm making fun projects like this game here. This one is a
             University project where I revised the classical Hangman game into a more
            child friendly game.
        </p>
        <p>This project started of like many others. Paper, ideas and a looot of coffee. The brainstorming started off
            slow and uncreative but after all the basic and dumbs ideas were written down some good ones finally appeared,
            classic brainstorming. The funny thing is, out of all the ideas on my paper mess, none involved frogs.
        </p>

        <p>Initially, the game concept started as a human running along the bottom of the screen. They would act as a progress
            bar moving forward when you got an answer right and stumbling when you got one wrong. If you failed too many times
            they would get too hurt and lose the race. There were a couple problems with this concept. First I was not satisfied
            with it. I simply didn't think it was very appealing. Second it was quite complicated as it required pictures of humans
            running and I am not an artist. Finally the game I imagined had three short cutscenes. An image to show the start of the
            race and another depending on if they won or lost to the unlikable character. To show the player that the
            main character was good, that he was competing with a jerk and finally motivate them these cutscenes were essential.
            However once again, I am not an artist.
            <br>So I went to look for images on the web and then I  found him. My love, my saviour, my answer. Froggy.
        </p>
            <img class="center" src="Froggy.png">
        <p>In one look I had already abandoned the previous concept. The frog made so much sense! And it might have been the
            caffeine but my brain was instantly inspired. Lily pads for lives and if you ran out the frog would fall in the water.
            Frogs were cute, appealing to children, easy to find and edit. And as a bonus the core of the game stayed the same. The
            frog was like a progress bar jumping from lily pad to lily pad every time you guessed wrong. However in this case the outcome
            was clear and you could see how close you were to failing.
            <br>I looked a bit longer and soon found a background for the game and lily pads Froggy could jump on. Unfortunately
            the original Froggy was too big so I also found another frog image. I might still try and edit the original Froggy to make
            him the main character though. And then I was only missing the details. I jumped unto Figma (a prototyping website recommended
            by my university) and started working on the protype.
        </p>
            <img class="center" src="images\Screenshot Game.png">
        <p>When making the menu I also decided to have lily pad buttons. And seeing as how they were simple to make and I couldn't
            find one I liked in the internet, I made a simple on in GIMP (a free picture editing software). Then came the Menu, the Settings
            and Help page, and finally the Game. I looked for a background online and edited in GIMP to remove some of the clutter.
        </p>

                <div class="column"><img class="center" src="images\Background_Game.png"></div>
            </div>
        <p>At this point I was basically done and was finetuning the details as well as creating connections in Figma so it was more
            presentable to other. However I did make one major change. I removed the original Sign-In button and replaced it with Credits.
            As I became more familiar with HTML I realized I wouldn't be able to make accounts and I also wanted a way to give credits for 
            the images I am using.
            <br>Eventually I presented my project and received positive feedback. Specially regarding my effort. It made me proud of Froggy.
            <br>...And here we are now. The game is yet to be completed but the hardest part is done. And now you too know the story of Froggy Game.
            <br>I hope you enjoy my game:)
